## What is it about?

Are you a parent or grandparent concerned about the future of your kid(s) or their kid(s)?


In any case, you're in the right place. This application will help you!


You'll get prediction of the next few years' scores of your university of interest.

## How to use it

1. Just go to https://jonny.shinyapps.io/shiny

2. On the Application tab on the left side you can select a country, one of the popular universities in it, and the year for which you would like to predict the score.
Just try!

3. On the right side you will see the score.

## Algorithm

The prediction algorithm involves polynomial curves fitting model whenever possible, and uses the average of available scores if there isn't enough data.

If you are interested in inner implementation, let's look at prediction for John Hopkins University, for example:

```{r}
library(splines)
uni.data <- read.csv("data/world_university_rankings_2010_2015.csv", sep = ";")
uni.data$endYear <- as.integer(substr(uni.data$Year, 6, 9))
JHU.scores <- subset(uni.data, Institution == "Johns Hopkins University", c('endYear', 'Score'))
bsBasis <- bs(JHU.scores$endYear, df = 3)
fit <- lm(Score ~ bsBasis, data = JHU.scores)
result <- predict(fit, newdata = data.frame(endYear = 2016:2020))
names(result) <- 2016:2020
result
```
